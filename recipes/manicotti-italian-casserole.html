    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Some members of my family call it manicotti, some call it Italian casserole. So I call it Manicotti Italian Casserole. This is one of my all time favorite meals to make, and it's super easy! For gatherings I make the whole recipe, for my family I cut it in half.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound rigatoni pasta</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can mushrooms, drained</li>
        <li>2 (32 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>1 Â½ pounds shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>thinly sliced pepperoni</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boil. Pour in rigatoni, and cook until al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, and set pasta aside. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, brown ground beef and italian sausage in a large skillet over medium heat. With a slotted spoon, remove beef and sausage to a baking dish. Stir mushrooms, spaghetti sauce, and cooked pasta into the baking dish. Sprinkle cheese and pepperoni over the top. </li>
        <li> Bake in preheated oven until the cheese is brown and bubbly, about 20 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
